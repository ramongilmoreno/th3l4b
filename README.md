======

Making things simpler:

* Only "points-to" references (equivalent to "many-to-one")
* Only one type of model (no more normalized model)
* Identifiers will be strings
* Support for target platforms (databases or programming languages) will include text-based and native variants.
* Types needs simplification (actually, types will be removed from base implementation. Only strings used)
* Now with Gradle as build engine.
* Syncing fully implemented
